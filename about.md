Hi! I'm Margaret Shipra Patrick. I completed my Bachelors in commerce from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata and currently pursuing business management. I love reading about philosophical and mystical topics and writing has been passion for me and so I'm here, hope to provide some really informative articles. Besides reading I love going out, meeting new people, making new friends, exploring new places, learning about new cultures and their lifestyles and of course I'm a big epicure. Lately I developed interest in cooking, someday I can put some really yummy recipes for you all.
