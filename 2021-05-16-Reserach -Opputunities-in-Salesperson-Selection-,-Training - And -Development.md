Customers expect salespeople to be more knowledgeable, respond more quickly, and give value-added, tailored solutions to their concerns. To do so, salespeople must form closer, longer-term ties with their clients than they have in the past. The nature of the salesperson's relationship with his or her company has changed dramatically. This viewpoint emerges from the rejection of a hierarchical and one-sided view of salespeople as contract employees hired by an organisation to serve its selling goals.
When salespersonâ€“organization relationships are the focus of attention, it raises a number of questions about training and development efforts. Thus, rather than asking how an organisation can train and develop its salesperson resource, this viewpoint asks us to consider how organisations and salespeople can increase the value of their mutual relationship through mutual knowledge development.

## TRENDS
### SALES PERSON TRAINING AND DEVLOPMENT
In line with the current cost-cutting and downsizing pressures, management is increasingly questioning the value of costly Training and development programs . Salespeople no longer make a career out of selling for one company throughout their professional lives. Rather they mostly work multiple jobs and for multiple companies throughout their careers. Therfore the companies now do not want to invest fpr employees who want to be an asset to other company
Salespeople are questioning the value of traditional TD programmes in an increasingly dynamic and competitive market. Today's sales environment places a premium on solutions, customer relationships, and information. These sales requirements have proven to be less amenable to standardised and structured TD offerings that are one-size-fits-all.
Salespeople frequently believe that interacting with customers allows them to learn more effectively than sitting in a training room, and that traditional TD programmes are ineffective 

 Knowledge, skill Ability (Task, Growth, Meta)
 

Task-related KSAs typically refer to essential elements that a salesperson must possess in order to begin selling the company's offerings. Such programmes' underlying theory is based on a behavioural approach to selling. The approach is motivated by the desire to influence a behavioural change in the modelling, role playing, and reinforcing fundamentals The emphasis is not on comprehending the mental state. or the psychological or motivational underpinnings of this behavioural change
Their effectiveness is relatively simple to determine.
The development of growth-related KSAs is based on learning theories. Understanding how individuals learn and mobilising the KSAs that enhance learning is critical for growth-related KSAs. This interest stems in part from growing scepticism about the efficacy of behavioral-based sales training programmes.


## SALESPERSON SELECTION
While the main elements in the design and validation of personnel selection procedures have been in place for some time (e.g., job analysis, performance assessment instruments, and validation), recent work in industrial organisational (IO) psychology has made advances in several areas.
Selection is a prediction exercise with three stages: job analysis, selection decision, and validation. This basic three-step process, which differs only slightly, has served as the foundation for textbook treatment of selection processes.
There are numerous assessment procedures available today for the purpose of selecting salespeople. Here these procedures are divided into five distinct domains: Assessments of job skills/knowledge, personality inventories, biodata, cognitive ability tests, and special purpose sales assessment
Job Skills/Knowledge Assessments	Measurement of sales-related skills and information, such as personal selling, planning, and time management, using a pencil-and-paper test or a structured interview. Most job skills/knowledge are acquired through experience and training in sales positions
Cognitive Ability Tests	Assessments of general mental ability as well as specific cognitive abilities related to sales positions, such as verbal comprehension, numerical ability, and visual speed and accuracy.
Personality Inventories	Assessments of long-term dispositions that show consistent reactions to situations. The most commonly studied personality dimensions among salespeople are dominance, empathy, need for achievement, need for power, responsibility, sociability, and self-esteem
Biographical Information	Assessments of demographic, educational, occupational, and other background information, typically using pencil-and-paper inventories.
Special Purpose Sales Assessments	Empirically developed measurement using pencil-and-paper tests aimed specifically at predicting salesperson performance.

The most important feature of any assessment tool is its predictive validity, or its ability to predict future job performance, job-related learning through training or development programmes, and other criteria. This predictive objective is based on the belief that prior to hiring, assessments of individual differences will account for a large portion of the variability in sales performance. Because of the greater standard deviation in individual performance in sales compared to other positions, the potential payoff from improved selection processes may be greater in sales than in other occupations.

## EMERGING ISSUES
Because of the increasing heterogeneity and demands of the sales position, this is an exciting time for sales force research. To begin, we must better understand the nature and extent of the changes in sales positions. Perhaps a revised taxonomy of selling positions is required.
In the training area, we have prioritised growth-related KSAs and meta-KSAs over traditional task-related KSAs. Many questions, however, remain unanswered.
For example, given that some training in the area of task-related KSAs is still required, what is the proper balance between the three types of training?
Another question is which of the growth-related and meta-KSAs are most important for the successful development of successful salespeople, and how much of this is determined by the nature of the sales position
In the selection area, we proposed a number of factors that may explain variation in successful sales performance. Very obvious that  Emotional intelligence, practical intelligence, and coping skills are cognitive skills worthy of further investigation, as are personality factors such as integrity, optimism, social competence, and biodata. 
Finally, two contextual factors that have become increasingly common in sales organisations should be highlighted: team selling and cross-cultural selling. International and multinational organisations have a greater need for better selection processes and measurement tools as global markets expand, sales teams become more culturally diverse, and expatriate sales assignments increase.
